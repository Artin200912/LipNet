# LipNet: A Deep Learning Model for Lip Reading

LipNet is a deep learning model designed to recognize speech from video of lips. It's a groundbreaking project that combines the strengths of deep learning with the precision of lip reading, enabling machines to understand speech without the need for audio input. This project aims to bridge the gap between speech recognition and visual understanding, offering a novel approach to communication between humans and machines.

## Features

- **Real-time Lip Reading**: LipNet can recognize speech in real-time, making it suitable for applications where immediate feedback is crucial.
- **High Accuracy**: Leveraging deep learning techniques, LipNet achieves high accuracy in speech recognition, even in noisy environments.
- **Cross-lingual Capabilities**: The model is designed to be adaptable to different languages, making it a versatile tool for global applications.
- **Open Source**: The project is open source, allowing researchers and developers to contribute, use, and adapt the model for various applications.
